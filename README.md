# my_cs_flutter_app


## Description

This project is a Flutter application that uses a **Feature First** architecture. Each feature of the app is modular, containing its own screens, widgets, and state management logic. This approach ensures scalability and maintainability by keeping all related components of a feature in one place.

## Features

- **Home Screen**: A main screen with buttons that navigate to different component implementations.
- **Button Feature**: A screen with a custom button implementation.
- **Radio Button Feature**: A screen with a custom radio button implementation.
- **Switch Feature**: A screen with a switch implementation.
- **Slider Feature**: A screen with a slider implementation.
- **Progress Indicator Feature**: A screen with a progress bar implementation.

## Architecture: Feature First

The project is structured using a **Feature First** architecture. This means that the code is organized by feature, where each feature contains its own logic, UI, and state management components. This pattern promotes modularity and makes it easier to scale and maintain the app.
